# 🎮 Echo Loop

> *“Some loops are meant to be broken… and some, lived forever.”*

**Echo Loop** is a 2D platformer prototype built with the Godot Engine.

Right now, it's a simple playable build — you can **walk**, **jump**, and explore basic **platforms**. But a deeper, story-driven world is under construction. This is just the beginning.

## 🧠 Game Concept (Coming Soon...)

You wake up in a world stuck in a **time loop**.  
The environment changes. You don't remember why.  
Each loop pulls you deeper into something you're meant to forget — or maybe rediscover.

This is the core idea behind **Echo Loop**, a minimalist puzzle-platformer about **memory**, **repetition**, and **escape**.
